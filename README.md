# Data Studio Project 2: [CEO Compensation](https://rachel-el-p.github.io/ceocompensation/)

This is my submission for the Data Studio class' second assignment.

My plan was to look at the pay of large corporation CEOs who recently announced they were taking a pay cut. Most of these companies, which are mostly in tech and banking, also laid off workers recently due to the market rout that started in 2022 amid rising interest rates, elevated inflation rates, and consumers cutting their post-pandemic spending on goods. Even though these CEOs said they were taking a pay cut, it comes after they collected millions — if not hundreds of millions — of dollars every year in pay due to their bonuses and stock options. And some of these CEOs are still going to rake in a lot of money this year if they only cut their base salary, which make up a small portion of their compensation. 

I looked at company 14-A documents filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission to get the information of CEO pay, workers pay, and pay ratio. From CompaniesMarketCap, Standard and Poor's, and NASDAQ, I got the information on companies' market capitalization and stock market index performance. I added the information to Google Sheets to calculate the changes and save the information as CSV files. I then used ggplot to create the graphics and cleaned them up in Adobe Illustrator, before using ai2html to insert them in my html.

## Skills learned: 
I used this chance to practice ggplot, Adobe Illustrator, and fine-tuning it on ai2html. 

## Things I would've liked to do:
I wished I spent less time on data analysis and knew what I wanted to plot. There was a lot of data and my initial charts, which tried to graph all the companies over time — e.g. the ceo-to-worker pay ratio of every company from 2018 to 2023 — ended up looking messy, especially when some company data was unavailable for specific years. I had to figure out how to simplify my charts and still tell a story.
